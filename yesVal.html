    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>

    <p>
      I know we’re miles apart, but I wanted to make something just for you.
      Something small that says what I don’t always get to say.
    </p>
    <h2>Us, So Far</h2>
    <p>
      Four months ago, I didn’t know how important you’d become to me.
      Now you’re part of my everyday — my favorite messages, my best calls,
      the person I think about more than I probably admit.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Distance</h2>
    <p>
      Long distance isn’t always easy, but you make it feel worth it.
      I love how we show up for each other, even from far away.
    </p>

    <div class="heart">🤍</div>

    <p>
      I’m really grateful for you.
      I’m glad it’s you.
